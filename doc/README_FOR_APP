The Raids Per Loot system has been created as a means to distribute loot in
casual and semi-casual guilds who don't have a consistent raid force.

Southern Cross (http://southerncross.guildportal.com), is one of those guilds.
As raid leader, I wanted a loot system with the following characteristics:

* Participation must be rewarded consistently
* Frequency of participation should not impact chances of getting loot
* Waiting for "better loot" to drop should not be be encouraged, but it also
  should not be impossible
* Players should be able to choose to raid with two characters without disrupting
  the fairness of the loot system or sacrifice the viability of the raid force

Southern Cross previously used /random to distribute loot, and while it met
the 2nd and 3rd criteria, it didn't meet the other.  We'd tried a watered
down DKP system, but points hoarding caused it to also fail on some counts.

RaidsPerLoot meets all 3.

The formula is: "raids.count / (drops.count + 1)".
This formula is calculated for each drop category.

The system caters for loot for main characters and alternates, along with ranks
for each player.
We use this system for EverQuest 2, but all values such as player classes, player
ranks, item slots and drop categories are editable to allow this system to be
reconfigured for any MMO.
